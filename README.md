# The BlissInterface package

* Website: https://gap-packages.github.io/BlissInterface/
* Repository: https://github.com/gap-packages/BlissInterface

This package provides a low level interface to the software [***bliss:*** A Tool for Computing Automorphism Groups and Canonical Labelings of Graphs](http://www.tcs.hut.fi/Software/bliss/), written by Tommi Junttila and Petteri Kaski. 

The BlissInterface package uses an external binary and therefore a complete installation only works on UNIX systems or systems that support a UNIX-like environment, e.g. OS X, or Windows with Cygwin. 

On the package website precompiled binaries are available for certain environments. To compile the package, change to the `/pkg/BlissInterface*` directory  of your GAP installation and then call
	
	./configure <path>

where <path> is a path to the main GAP root directory; so normally you would call

	./configure ../..

(the `../..` is the default and so may be omitted) and then call

	make 
  
to compile the binary.

Now start GAP and type

	LoadPackage("BlissInterface");

to load the package. You will see the package banner. If you have not compiled the external binary, you should receive a warning.

For details on how to use the BlissInterface package see the package documentation in the `doc` subdirectory (view its HTML version or  `manual.pdf`  via a PDF viewer).
